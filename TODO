HA Cluster (pacemaker/corosync)  Charm
======================================
 * Peer-relations
   - make sure node was added to the cluster
   - make sure node has been removed from the cluster (when deleting unit)
   * One thing that can be done is to:
     1. ha-relation-joined puts node in standby.
     2. ha-relation-joined makes HA configuration
     3. on hanode-relation-joined (2 or more nodes)
        - services are stopped from upstart/lsb
        - nodes are put in online mode
        - services are loaded by cluster
        - this way is not in HA until we have a second node.
 * Needs to communicate the VIP to the top service
 * TODO: Fix Disable upstart jobs
   - sudo sh -c "echo 'manual' > /etc/init/SERVICE.override"

  update-rc.d -f pacemaker remove
  update-rc.d pacemaker start 50 1 2 3 4 5 . stop 01 0 6 .

TODO: Problem seems to be that peer-relation gets executed before the subordinate relation.

In that case, peer relation would have to put nodes in standby and then the subordinate relation
will have to put the nodes online and configure the services. Or probably not use it at all.

Hanode-relation puts node in standby.
ha-relation counts nodes in hanode-relation and if >2 then we online them and setup cluster.
